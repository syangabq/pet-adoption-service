# API Reference

The Pet Adoption Service API is a REST API with the following resources:

* [User](user/index.md)
* [Pet](pet/index.md)

{: .note }
The docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends on the installation of the service. When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`.

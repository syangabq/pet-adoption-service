# Pet Adoption service API

**Help cats and dogs find their forever homes!**

The Pet Adoption service API allows developers to create applications that assist people in adopting cat and dog companions.

## Get started

## API reference

The Pet Adoption service API is a REST API with the following resources:

* [User](api/user.md)
* [Pet](api/pet.md)

{: .note }
The docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends on the installation of the service. When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`.
